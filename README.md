# Media Library

## Description
This is command-line media library entirely built in Ruby. It will be a project
for my portfolio.  
This library will allow users to enter a music album, movie, of computer game,
and add different types of information depending on the media type. For example:
games allow you to enter a platform, whereas movies and albums allow you to
enter a format. There are certain attributes like rating and genre that all of
media types have.  
Whenever an entry is made it will be auto-saved to a CSV file, and whenever the
app is loaded, the content of the CSV file is auto-loaded into the app.  
The user interface is a simple command-line menu with sub-menus that the user
can browse through using the keyboard.
